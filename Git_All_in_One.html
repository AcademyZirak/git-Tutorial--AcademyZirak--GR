            - A version control system.
            - git-scm.com
            - free and local tool(downloadable).
            - can only be accessed from a registered user on a special computer.
            - this is where github comes into play.

            - github.com
            - A development platform.
            - Hosted on the cloud (not local).
            - free for basic user.
            - collaborate with other programmers
            - Github is a git repository hosting provider.
            

            - git and github are 2 different tools.
            - they are 2 different services.
            - they perfectly work together.


            - git has a command line interface.
            

            - Consider our website files are in a folder named 'shop'
            - Simply this folder contains index.html, styles.css and images folder.
            - git calls the main folder of our project, 'Working Directory'

            - git calls every snapshot of the project a 'commit'

            - A commit is a snapshot of all the files and folders of the project at a certain time.

            - First commit = first snapshot
            
            - (VIP) git does not stores different files.
                 if you change the first file it just stores the changes not the files.
            - git calls the the first files plus the changes, commit number 2.

            - Storing files would not be efficient.

            - git is all about tracking changes not about storing files.

            - All The commits or all the saving logic of the commits are stored in the main branch or master branch.

            - Master branch stores all the changes made throughout the project.

            - When we convert a project folder to a git working directory

        <pre>
            - First of all we need to set a username and email to use git
             because several people can work on a project.

             - Setting username:
             >> git config --global user.name "your_username"


             - Setting email:
             >> git config --global user.email "your_email"
             - use the email that you have registered on git-hub with.
             

             - Setting the default editor for git 
             >> git config --global core.editor editor_name
             we can use code or nano editor

             - Go to github.com and make a repository and download it.
                copy the https link.

             - In this tutorial we use a test repository of Academy Zirak.
             - [https://github.com/AcademyZirak/git-Tutorial-Test--AcademyZirak--GR.git]
             - You should make your own repository and use it.

             - to save the repository open your terminal and navigate to the folder of your projects.

             >> git clone copied_URL

             - To see if the repository has changed or not go into the repository using cd and :
             >> git status


             - md is abbreviation for mark down
               github repos usually have a file named README.md to introduce the repository.

             - Change this file a little bit and then type
              >> git status again.

             - To send the modifications to git local repo...
             >> git add README.md

             - this add command sends the changes to the staging section of git
             this means the changes are not still added(committed) to the local repo

             - To commit the changes to the local repository:
             >> git commit -m "your_message"
             any commit needs a message like: "this is the first edition"


             - Now that the changes have been committed to the file we should send the file to the main repo on github.
             >> git push  
             then enter your username and password.
             Done!
             <hr>



             - Now, what if we want to change more than 1 file or make some folders?

             - go inside the local repo and make folder1 with 2 files inside it. file1.txt and file2.txt

             >> git status
                shows only one folder because the changed files are only in folder 1.

             >> git add folder_name
             >> git status
             >> git commit -m "1 folder with 2 files were added to the repo"
             >> git push

             - Now edit file1.txt and file2.txt  delete sth and add sth to them.
             >> git status

             now more than 1 file has been modified and we do not want to type the name of all the files!
             >> git add .
             >> git status
             above command adds the changes of all the files inside the local repo to the staging section

            
            >> git push
